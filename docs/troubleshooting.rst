======================================================
I cannot see the P.Plotter Panel after installation
======================================================

The Panel will only appear if you are |viewing though the Active Camera|.

============================================================================================================
I cannot make the vanishing Points match a 2D sketch or photo
============================================================================================================

If it is a sketch of a concept, or an image that may be distorted/cropped, it may be something to do with the image not being entirely perfect.  Double check that you are happy that the sketch's vanishing points are accurate.

Try different vanishing point modes: If in 2-point mode, try experimenting with the position of the *Principal Point* (which is used to estimate the 3rd vanishing point) or switching to another perspective mode.  If in 1-point perspective mode, try experimenting with the *Focal Length* which has to be provided in this mode.

======================================================
No, I've checked, and they don't match!
======================================================

:ref:`Get in touch<Contact>` and we'll be very happy to check the add-on for any bugs.
