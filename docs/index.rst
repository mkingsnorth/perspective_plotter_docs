---------------------------------
What is Perspective Plotter?
---------------------------------

Match a camera to an image with Perspective Plotter , an interactive |Blender| add-on for modelers, architects and artists.  This is useful for creating 3D models from 2D sketches, matching a 3D scene to a 2D photo, or animating a camera dynamically to match a video.

Defining perspective lines in the viewport sets a camera's focal length, location and position in real time.  The add-on will also work with more than one camera in a scene.

Additional :ref:`tools<Tools>` allow you to match a camera's background image proportions, quickly move vertices or objects along the view line, and automatically flatten the horizon.

The add-on is inspired by the freely available |fSpy| application, with the added benefit of being directly inside Bender.
