---------------------------------
What is Perspective Plotter?
---------------------------------

|Perspective Plotter| is a |Blender| add-on for modellers, architects and artists who need to match a Blender camera to a still image.  This is useful for creating 3D models from 2D sketches, matching a 3D scene to a 2D image, or animating a camera dynamically.

Defining perspective lines in the viewport sets a camera's focal length, location and position in real time.  Additional tools allow you to match a camera's background image proportions, and quickly move vertices or objects along a view line.

The add-on is inspired by the freely available |fSpy| application, with the added benefit of being directly inside Bender: you do not need import the camera settings.
